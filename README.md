# WhatsAppToDiscord

WhatsAppToDiscord is a Discord bot uses WhatsApp Web for messaging in Discord build on top of [go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) and [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)

### Features

- Way too low memory usage than a web browser.
- Open Source (You can always compile your own)
- Self Hosted (So your data keeps on you)

But most importantly you can open **Discord overlay** and reply to your messages **without a break.**

### Setup
Please see [Wiki](https://github.com/FKLC/WhatsAppToDiscord/wiki)

### This library is not something revolutionary

It uses the libraries already out there so all the kudos must go to [go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) and [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) projects. I just integrated them.
